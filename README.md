This repo has my  example of Facebook. 

For this example I created both the front end and the back end.

For the front end I'm using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AngularJS, DustJS and Bootstrap.
For the backend I'm using NodeJS with ExpressJS and some other modules from NodeJS.
I'm also testing a little MongoDb database. It is used to authenticate the user.
